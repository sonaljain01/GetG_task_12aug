# React Project Setup Guide

This guide will help you set up a React project from scratch using the Create React App tool. Follow the steps below to get started.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (version 14.x or later)
- **npm** (comes with Node.js)
- **npx** (comes with npm)

You can check if Node.js and npm are installed by running the following commands in your terminal:

```bash
node -v
npm -v

## Setting Up a New React Project

1. Create a New React App
Use the npx command to create a new React app. Replace my-app with your desired project name.

npx create-react-app my-app

This command will create a new directory called my-app and set up all the necessary files and dependencies for a React project.

2. Navigate to Your Project Directory
Once the setup is complete, navigate to the project directory:

cd my-app

3. Start the Development Server
To start the development server and open your React app in the browser, run the following command:

npm start

This will open the app at http://localhost:3000/ in your default web browser.

4. Explore the Project Structure
Your new React project comes with a basic structure:

node_modules/: Contains all the npm packages your project depends on.
public/: Static files like index.html and icons.
src/: Source code of your React app. Contains components, styles, and other assets.
package.json: Lists the project's dependencies, scripts, and other configurations.
README.md: This file.

5. After that changes are made in your app.js file which locates in src folder, according to your requirement
src/app.js
